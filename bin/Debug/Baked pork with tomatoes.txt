 And here is the recipe for the baked pork with tomatoes.

 Ingredients:
 Pork slices (preferably pork shoulder or tenderloin)
 Garlic cloves
 Vegetable oil (sunflower oil or olive oil)
 Canned Tomato puree
 Dried thyme
 Bay leaves

 Steps:
 1. Preheat the oven. 
 While you prepare the pork and the tomato sauce, the oven is heating up.

 2. Prepare the meat. 
 Season each slice with salt and pepper and place them in a roasting 
 pan large enough to accommodate all of them in one layer.

 3. Make the sauce. Combine garlic, vegetable oil, tomato puree, 
 dried thyme, and bay leaves. Pour this sauce over the meat.

 4. Bake the meat. Cover the roasting pan with aluminum foil 
 and bake in the oven for about 45 minutes. 
 Then, uncover the roasting pan and bake for another 15 minutes. 
 The meat should be tender and cooked through1.

 Enjoy your meal!
